Please follow these guidelines and contact us if you have any questions.<br><br>2. In case of a medical emergency, do not use the Portal/app to communicate with us. Please dial 911 (or the equivalent local emergency number from the country you are in) and then contact your treating doctor.<br><br>3. By using the Portal/app and this site you confirm that you are older than 18 years of age. Parents can use the Portal/app for their children under 18 years of age, however, communication in the portal/app will be with the parent of the participant.<br><br>4. You agree not to use the Portal for any purpose other than to communicate with us about your case. You agree not to attempt to circumvent any security safeguard that we use to protect the security of our information systems. <br>5. Upon registering you will provide us with your preferred email address. If your eligibility is confirmed you will receive an e-mail with login credential to the Portal/app.<br><br>6. You will receive an email whenever you have scheduled an appointment through the Portal/app. The e-mail will not contain confidential health information, but will prompt you to sign into the Portal.<br><br>7. If you are representing someone else and choose to share any of their contact information with us, you must verify that you have express consent from that person to do so and we will do the same.<br><br>8. The Portal/app has safeguards that are intended to prevent unauthorized parties from being able to access or read messages while they are in transmission. However, keeping messages secure depends on two important factors. First, we need you to make sure we have your correct email address and you MUST inform us it ever changes, and second, you should keep unauthorized individuals from learning your Portal/app username and password. If you think someone has learned your password, you should notify us and then you should promptly go to the Portal/app and change it.<br><br>9. Messages and files sent and received through the Portal/app may be included in our records, but may be deleted in accordance with our records retention policy.<br><br>11. The operation of the Portal/app may be interrupted by problems with computer hardware or software, interruptions in internet services, computer viruses or other problems beyond our control. If you need to reach us and the Portal/app is not working, please call us through the phone number in the Contact Us section of the website.<br><br>12. Do not use your regular e-mail account to send us confidential information since regular e-mail is not secure. All electronic communication from you to Advance Medical should be through the Portal.<br><br>13. Any of our staff may read or reply to your messages or telephone messages.<br><br>14. These Terms of Service are subject to change without prior notice. We retain the right to modify, discontinue, or suspend the Portal/app service for any reason at any time.</p>",

By clicking \"I AGREE\" you are entering into a legally binding agreement with Teladoc and expressly accepting these Terms and the Privacy Policy.</p><p>Acceptance of these Terms is a condition of use for the Service.</p><p><strong>We Care</strong></p><p>The purpose of the Portal is to make routine, non-emergency communication more convenient and to provide you with fast and secure access to our health professionals.</p><p>In case of a medical emergency, do not use the Portal to communicate with us. <br>Please dial the relevant local emergency number for the country you are in, and then contact your treating doctor.</p><p><strong>Service limitation/restrictions</strong></p><p>The Portal has, by its own nature certain limitations/restrictions regarding the Service and does not replace face-to-face consultations with your treating doctor or primary healthcare practitioner, nor does it replace primary healthcare. Face-to face consultations are always essential in cases of medical emergencies and where physical examination/intervention is required.</p><p>You are responsible for providing the Healthcare Professionals with the information that they advise is required in order to provide you with the Service.</p><p>If following use of the Portal, you have doubts or concerns regarding the professional advice/service provided, or regarding your health and wellbeing, please seek further medical assistance in a regular face-to-face consultation.</p><p>As with any other healthcare service, no results can be guaranteed or assured.</p><p><strong>Geographical restrictions</strong></p><p>You should check whether you are entitled to access our services in the territory where you are. Teladoc makes no representation that the Service available through the App/Portal is appropriate, legal or available for use in all and any location.</p><p><strong>Privacy</strong></p><p>Teladoc provides its services in compliance with EU Data Protection laws. It does not, however, take responsibility for any differences between those rules and any different rules applying to healthcare services anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Identity Checks and Authentication</strong></p><p>a) Initial authentication: Performing a physical comparison by photo ID verification:</p><p>We partner with Onfido in order to perform this procedure. This only ever needs to be done once. Thereafter we will simply ask a combination of security question along with your contact details.</p><p>New Patient Registrations through our APP: our agent will simultaneously assign the case to our doctor and send the patient an email explaining the identity check process.</p><p>1) We will ask the patient to verify identity by taking a picture of their passport, driver license, NationalIdentity card, or residence permit and thereafter following a few short steps where they will take a \"selfie\" and the identity check will be complete.</p><p>If the photographic ID does not have the address, then we will ask for a further non-photographic document to confirm the patient address. This process should ordinarily only take a few minutes.</p><p>2) Security question for ongoing authentication. That is to say, you will not be asked to confirm identity for subsequent consultations, instead at the point of registration, we will ask you to choose a security question: Mother's Maiden Name, Name of first school, Town of birth for example. With this, and the usual data protection questions - our doctor will be able to proceed with all subsequent consultations.</p><p>If the patient is consulting on behalf of their child, we will ask for proof of parental responsibility before creating a unique file for the child. This will usually be a birth certificate of the child's passport with matching surnames as the parent.</p><p>b) Ongoing authentication:</p><p>1: Check credentials against eligibility data provided by the client - typically an insurer.</p><p>2: The first time a patient contacts our platform, as above, along with identification verification, they are requested to define some security questions.</p><p>3: Afterwards, whenever they are request a medical consultation, they are requested to provide - full name, date of birth, home address and provide a correct response to the security questions. This way we ensure we are talking to the correct person.</p><p>Audits are performed to ensure that the above-mentioned process is followed by listening to phone recordings and ensuring that the protocol is accurately being used.</p><p><strong>Prescriptions</strong></p><p>Subject to the applicable law, Health Professionals may issue prescription for medicines only when, in their professional judgement, it is in your best interest to receive the medicine, and always in accordance with the Teladoc Prescription Policy.</p><p>You agree that: (i) any prescriptions you acquire from a Health Professional are solely for your personal use</p>",
